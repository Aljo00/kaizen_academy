# Kaizen Academy Thrithala — PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Build a world-class, premium, modern educational institution website for Kaizen Academy Thrithala, comparable to Xylem, PW, Eduport — premium ed-tech startup feel with cinematic motion, conversion focus, multi-page (Home/About/Courses/Contact), Resend-powered admission enquiry form.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 19 (CRA) + Tailwind + Shadcn primitives + Framer Motion + Lenis smooth scroll + custom canvas particle network
- **Backend**: FastAPI on :8001 with `/api` prefix, MongoDB (motor)
- **Email**: Resend (`auth.classvia.in` sender domain, recipient `kaizenacademy5@gmail.com`)
- **Routing**: react-router-dom v7 — `/`, `/about`, `/courses`, `/contact`

- Students self-discovering programs and applying
- Visitors connecting via WhatsApp / Instagram / phone

## Core Requirements (Static)
